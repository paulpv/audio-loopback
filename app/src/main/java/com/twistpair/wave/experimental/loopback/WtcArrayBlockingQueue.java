         * There is definitely a race-condition between "add" and "take"/"poll"/"maintenance".
         * 
         * The reason is described in the javadoc for Object.notify():
         * 
         *      Causes a thread which is waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one
         *      of the wait() methods) to be woken up. If more than one thread is waiting, one of
         *      them is chosen at the discretion of the virtual machine.
         *      
         *      The chosen thread will not run immediately. The thread that called notify() has to
         *      release the object's monitor first.
         *      
         *      Also, the chosen thread still has to compete against other threads that try to
         *      synchronize on the same object.
         *
         * Basically, when "add" releases its lock, any threads calling "take", "poll", or
         * "maintenance" will race to [re-]acquire their lock. If "poll" or "maintenance" wins then
         * the queue will empty and "take" will throw NoSuchElementException.
         * 
         * I have tried a few techniques to solve this, but none were simple, fast, or appeared to
         * fix the problem.
         * 
         * For now the following workarounds are in place:
         *  1) Conveniently, no callers call *both* "take" and "poll", so they currently don't conflict with each other.
         *  2) "maintenance" only clears the queue if it is empty.
         *  
         * Maybe one day I will actually getting around to properly fixing this code.
